            The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft)
            above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars
            at 21,171 m (69,459 ft). The tallest mountain including submarine terrain is Mauna Kea in Hawaii from its
            underwater base at 9,330 m (30,610 ft); some scientists consider it to be the tallest on earth.

                A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant
                exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited
                summit
                area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 600 metres (2,000 ft) above the
                surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.

                Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism,[1] which act on time scales of up
                to
                tens of millions of years.[2] Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the
                action
                of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers
                and
                glaciers.
