<!--Attributes in HTML tags are used to provide additional information about an element. They are typically specified within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign, like name="value".

Common Attribute Uses
Attributes serve several key functions:
 * Providing essential data needed for the element to function (e.g., the destination URL for a link).
 * Modifying the default behavior or appearance of an element (e.g., setting the width of an image).
 * Making elements accessible (e.g., providing alternative text for an image).
 * Assigning identifiers for styling (CSS) or manipulation (JavaScript).
📝 Examples of Commonly Used Attributes

Here are two commonly used attributes:
1. The href Attribute
 * Used with: The anchor tag (<a>), which is used to create hyperlinks.
 * Function: Specifies the destination URL (web address) that the link points to. It tells the browser where to navigate when the link is clicked.
 * Example:--> 
   <a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>

<!--In this example, href is the attribute, and "https://www.google.com" is its value.

2. The src Attribute
 * Used with: The image tag (<img>), and also elements like <script> or <video>.
 * Function: Specifies the source or path to the external resource being embedded, such as an image file. It tells the browser where to find the content to display.
 * Example:-->
   <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">

<!--In this example, src is the attribute, and "logo.png" is its value (the path to the image file). The alt attribute, another common one, provides descriptive alternative text for screen readers or if the image fails to load.
