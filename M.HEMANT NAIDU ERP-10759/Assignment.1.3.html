<!--The primary purpose of the `<a>` tag in HTML is to create a **hyperlink**, which is a clickable element that links to another document, section, or resource. The 'a' stands for **anchor**.
This is the fundamental element used for navigation on the web, allowing users to jump from one page or resource to another.

## Hyperlink Syntax
The basic syntax for creating a hyperlink using the `<a>` tag is:-->
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
<!--
##  Explanation of Each Part

### 1)<a>` and </a>

  <a ...>`: This is the **opening tag** that signifies the beginning of the anchor element.
  * **`</a>`:** This is the **closing tag** that signifies the end of the anchor element. Everything between the opening and closing tags becomes the clickable part of the link.

### 2\. `href` Attribute

  * **`href`** stands for **Hypertext Reference**. This is the **most essential attribute** of the `<a>` tag.
  * It specifies the **destination URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) or path that the link should navigate to when clicked.
  * **Example:** If you want to link to Google, the attribute is written as `href="https://www.google.com"`.

### 3\. `Link Text`

  * This is the **visible, clickable content** that the user sees on the webpage.
  * It can be text, an image (by placing an `<img>` tag inside the `<a>` tags), or any other inline HTML element.
  * **Example:-->
  <a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>`
