<!--The fundamental difference between the `<ul>` and `<ol>` tags in HTML is how they **display and structure a list of items**.
   The **`<ul>`** tag creates an **Unordered List** (bullet points).
   The **`<ol>`** tag creates an **Ordered List** (numbered or lettered items).

## Basic Structure and Usage
Both types of lists use the **`<li>` (List Item)** tag inside the main list container to define each individual item.

### 1\. `<ul>` - Unordered List
The basic structure is:-->

<ul>
  <li>List Item 1</li>
  <li>List Item 2</li>
  <li>List Item 3</li>
</ul>

<!--#### Usage:
Use `<ul>` when the items are simply a collection, and changing their sequence wouldn't alter the meaning or correctness of the list.

  * **Shopping Lists:** Items to buy (e.g., milk, eggs, bread).
  * **Feature Lists:** Key features of a product or service.
  * **Navigation Menus:** A list of links on a website where the arrangement is flexible.

### 2\. `<ol>` - Ordered List
The basic structure is:-->

<ol>
  <li>First step or item</li>
  <li>Second step or item</li>
  <li>Third step or item</li>
</ol>

<!--#### Usage:
Use `<ol>` when the items must be presented in a specific, meaningful sequence.
  * **Instructions/Steps:** A recipe or assembly guide (e.g., Step 1: Mix ingredients, Step 2: Bake at $180^\circ\text{C}$).
  * **Rankings:** Top 10 lists or a list of medal winners.
  * **Legal Documents:** Sections or clauses that are referenced by number.
